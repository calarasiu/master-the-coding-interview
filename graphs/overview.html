  <h1>Graphs</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>A set of values connected in a pair wise fashion - each node/ vertex is connected to other nodes through a so called edge</li>
    <li>used to represent connections - think of maps for example - amazon uses it for their recommendation engines/ g maps to detect the shortest path to your destination </li>
    <li>trees/linked lists are graphs</li>

    <li><h3>Graphs properties</h3></li>
    <li>1 a) directed graphs - -> / <- / <-> graphs whose edges have a direction one way or double direction - twitter uses directed graphs for the connections as you can follow someone but the followed person doesn't has to follow you back -> to pay attention when this are cyclic or acyclic graphs</li>
    <li>1 b) undirected graphs - 0-0-0 - graphs that have just double direction edges - facebook uses it for the friendship connections - is mutual - the person you are firend with needs to be friend with you as well </li>
    <li>2 a) weighted graphs - have information on the edges not just on nodes - for example the distance between 2 nodes</li>
    <li>2 b) unweighted graph - hold info just in their nodes </li>
    <li>3 a) cyclic graphs - the nodes are connected in a circular fashion - you have the possibility to go back to the start point(it doesn't need to be cyclic the whole graph but at least 3 nodes ) - maps</li>
    <li>3 b) acyclic graphs - you cannot go back to the starting point -> goes in one direction - </li>
    <li>DAG - directed acyclic graph - used by ioda blockchain website</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Different ways of creating graphs?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Edge list -> const graph = [[0,2], [2,3], [2,1], [1,3]]</li>
    <li>Adjacent list - the index is the value of the node(when the value is a number that can be used as index) or using the keys of an object and the values are the nodes neighbors</li>
    <li>Adjacent matrix - true(1/ the value for the weighted graphs)/ false(0) to confirm or deny the connection between nodes </li>

    <p>Graphs are difficult to scale, but indispensable when you want to implement relationships</p>
    <p>That is why most of the time we don't need to implement our own graphs - but to use tools like <a href="https://neo4j.com/"></a> - a popular database which allows us to build really fast graph databases</p>
