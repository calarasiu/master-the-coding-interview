  <li><h1>Data structures</h1>
      <p>Are different types of containers used to store data - each one being good at storing a different type of data - like the fridge - the backpack - the drawer</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how to build them - this is not very difficult as are offered with each language </li>
        <li><p>how to use them - here we have to think which one will make our code better - readable-scalable - fast</p>
          <p>always stored in RAM </p>

          <p>our goal is to minimize the job of the CPU and memory controller when storing/ accessing/ .. the data in RAM </p>
