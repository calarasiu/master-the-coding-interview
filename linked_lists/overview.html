  <h1>Linked lists - each element stores the data and the pointer to the next element</h1>
  <p>the first element is called the head and the last element is called the tail-(the pointer is null since there is nowhere to point to)</p>
  <img src="../images/linked-lists.jpg" alt="">
  <ul>
    <li>the linked lists spend less time for insertion and deletions - as indexes don't need to be changed</li>
    <p>even though in the worst case- the index where we want to insert/ delete is the last one - the time is still O(n) - since we need to traverse the whole list to find the index</p>
    <li>for look ups (/traversal) in linked lists while loops need to be used, since we don't know their length - we called this traversal</li>
    <p>not cache friendly since the elements are scattered all over memory => traversing is slower than looping through an array</p>
    <li><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/learn/lecture/12321244#overview">What is a pointer?</a>
    <p>A pointer is just a reference to a "shelf in memory"</p>
  <p>if 2 pointers reference to the same shelf in memory, even though one of them is deleted, the memory will still hold the content, until is not referenced anymore, and the garbage can be collected - the 2 pointer is deleted or points to another shelf  - this happens only for languages that have the memory managed automatically - garbage collected - not for low level languages where you have to manage your memory manually </p></li>
