  <h1>Sorting is one of the biggest problems big companies need to solve along with searching</h1>
  <p>Which is the problem with the .sort() method build in programming languages </p>
  <ol>
    <li>in js the elements are first being transformed in strings and then sorted by unicode characters - check the unicode table   (2 = 50)
      <p>to make sure the sort method works the way you expect it to add the function description to it ->function(a, b){a-b/ b-a/ a.localeSort(b)</p>
    </li>
    <li>in js the implementation of the methods is also dependent on the js engines used by different browsers - so the chrome one can differ from the firefox one</li>
    <li>there are many sorting algorithms and each of them are efficient for solving different sorting problems - check <a href="https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms">check sorting alg in action</a></li>
  </ol>
  <h1>Bubble sort</h1>
  <p>is the simplest and one of the less efficient ones - time complexity O(n^2)-average and space complexity O(1) - we are not creating any new data structures - </p>
