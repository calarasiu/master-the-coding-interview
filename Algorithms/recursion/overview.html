  <h1>Recursion</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Is useful for tasks that have repeated tasks to do - Looking for directories inside other directories in the computer to find files for ex</li>
  <li>a function that calls itself</li>
  <li>an object inside another object</li>
  <li>concept used in sorting and searching</li>
  <li>a problem that can occur with recursion is stack overflow - water grass animation - the computer will run out of memory if the it will call to many times the recursive function  - 
    <h3>Solution - every recursive function needs to have the following</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>the base case</li>
      <li>the recursive case</li>
      <li>get closer and closer and return when needed - usually it has 2 returns(base case and recursive case) - once the base case is meet it will start to empty the stack and the last function to return will be the first one called (the stack theory - from top(last) to bottom(first) )</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Anything that can be done using recursion it can be done with iteration(loops)</h3>
  <p>The Fibonacci and Factorial number for example can be done in both ways - but we need to keep in mind the pros and cons when deciding which way to go</p>
  <p>For example the fibonacci problem solved using recursion if is not implemented well (using dynamic programming and storing) - it can cost more time than iteration (O(n) with iteration and O(2^n)- recursion)</p>
  <p>Positive aspects - DRY and Readability </p>
  <p>Negative sides - Large stacks(memory) - can cause stacks overflows - is very costly(space complexity) and hard to grasps </p>

  <h3>When to use recursion - every time you are using a tree or converting something into a tree - consider recursion</h3>
  <p>DIVIDE AND CONQUER</p>
  <ol>
    <li>divided into a number of problems that are smaller instances of the same problem</li>
    <li>each instance of the problem is identical in nature</li>
    <li>the solutions of the instances can be combined to solve the problem at hand</li>
  </ol>
