  <h1>Recursion</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Is useful for tasks that have repeated tasks to do - Looking for directories inside other directories in the computer to find files for ex</li>
  <li>a function that calls itself</li>
  <li>an object inside another object</li>
  <li>concept used in sorting and searching</li>
  <li>a problem that can occur with recursion is stack overflow - water grass animation - the computer will run out of memory if the it will call to many times the recursive function  - 
    <h3>Solution - every recursive function needs to have the following</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>the base case</li>
      <li>the recursive case</li>
      <li>get closer and closer and return when needed - usually it has 2 returns(base case and recursive case) - once the base case is meet it will start to empty the stack and the last function to return will be the first one called (the stack theory - from top(last) to bottom(first) )</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
